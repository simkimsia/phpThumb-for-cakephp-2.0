This is for cakephp 2.0

Changes from original phpThumb v1.7.11

Remove dirname(@$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']) in phpthumb.class.php in line 1038

reason is because in cakephp 1.3
dirname(@$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']) returns /
in cakephp 2.0
dirname(@$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']) returns /index.php/webroot/path/to/image/uploads

example, /index.php/uploads/products

which causes problems when used with MeioUpload in terms of producing the thumbnails
